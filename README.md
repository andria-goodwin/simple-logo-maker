## Description
As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer. I built this project to test my knowledge of object oriented programming. This project will be helpful later on in my career when I may want a logo for my future projects. I learned a lot more about using jest to run tests while working on this project.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The Simple Logo Maker is very easy to use. All you have to do is open it in the command line, answer the questions, and then you have a custom logo generated as an SVG file. Below is a link to a video I put together of how to use the program:

I tested the application using Jest. To see the test run, watch the end of this video:
